# **Title of the Project**  
**Automating Healthcare Data Extraction and Insights with Azure AI and OpenAI**  
This project leverages Azure AI and OpenAI technologies to automate the extraction, structuring, and analysis of healthcare data from medical forms and prescriptions, providing a streamlined approach to patient record management.

## **About**  
The project focuses on automating healthcare data management by using Azure AI's capabilities, such as OCR, combined with OpenAI’s natural language processing. The solution helps extract data from handwritten and typed medical forms and prescriptions, converting them into structured, accessible digital formats. It also integrates with Power BI to visualize insights on patient demographics and hospital usage patterns. This system improves efficiency by reducing manual data entry, enhancing data accessibility, and supporting data-driven decision-making in healthcare settings.

## **Features**
- **Data Extraction:** Uses Azure Form Recognizer to capture and digitize patient information and treatment details from medical forms.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Employs OpenAI’s API to summarize and query patient data using conversational language.
- **Data Storage:** Utilizes Azure Blob Storage to securely store structured data.
- **Data Visualization:** Displays insights and trends through a Power BI dashboard for easy interpretation of patient records.
- **Real-Time Insights:** Provides healthcare providers with real-time access to essential patient data for improved decision-making.

## **Requirements**
- **Operating System:** Requires Windows 10 or later, or Ubuntu for compatibility with Azure AI services.
- **Cloud Platform:** Azure services (Azure Form Recognizer, Azure OpenAI, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Factory) are essential for cloud-based data management.
- **Programming Language:** Python (3.6 or later) for backend processing and API interactions.
- **Visualization Tools:** Power BI for data visualization and report generation.
- **Development Environment:** Any Python IDE (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm) to develop and test the code.
- **Additional Libraries:** Azure SDKs (e.g., azure-ai-formrecognizer), OpenAI API, Power BI Python SDK.

## **System Architecture**  
The system integrates multiple Azure services to provide a complete workflow from document extraction to data visualization. Below is the architecture diagram:

*The Power BI dashboard displays insights about patient demographics, treatment patterns, and hospital usage for easier decision-making.*

**Detection Accuracy:** 98% (The performance metrics may vary depending on the specific forms processed.)

## **Results and Impact**  
This project demonstrates how automation can reduce inefficiencies in healthcare data management. By eliminating manual entry, it not only saves time but also ensures greater accuracy in handling sensitive patient information. The ability to query and visualize patient data in real-time aids healthcare professionals in making informed decisions quickly, especially in critical situations. This project has the potential to scale across large healthcare networks, further improving patient care.
